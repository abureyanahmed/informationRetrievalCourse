type sbt run

query is hard coded.

will be submitting only code for Qn 5 and 4 online. Will be slipping in hard copy into mihai's room.

Please grade code along with hard copy. Details are mentioned in teh hard copy.


I havent had time to attach a parser to the user input. So the code might fail for complicated queries.

It will work for standard queries with words separated by spaces
Eg: "information retrieval"
"dog labrador"
