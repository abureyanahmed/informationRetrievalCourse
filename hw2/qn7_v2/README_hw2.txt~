How to run:

Self explanatory/follow the instructions on screen.


In qn 7, In the input file, I am assuming there is a space between the word "doc" and document id" Eg: "Doc 1". Kindly input the files accordingly, or use the sample input file provided in the resources folder (/src/main/resources)


Also in Qn 7: I am assuming the input will be in small letters. My parser will through an error if it sees "Drug" instead of "drug". I can fix it to take capital letters too, but then I thought this is not a compilers class and you probably wont care.

Proximity is defined to start from 1. i.e the proximity between the words drug and schizophrenia in "drug schizophrenia" is 1 and  "drug for schizophrenia" is 2.
