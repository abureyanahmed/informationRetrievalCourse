1040,"(Mashable) Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven’t confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance.

Three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad that’s been under ISIS control since June 2014. The reports, however, have perpetuated mostly in pro-government and Kurdish media.

“We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable."


1634,"ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has reportedly been killed by a U.S. airstrike, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

The ISIS leader was killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer. A Pentagon spokesperson did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users have passed around an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body. It was also reported by Iraqi News.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did say that any ISIS leaders “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was known as the world’s “most powerful jihadi leader” and “the new Bin Laden.”

“The true heir to Osama bin Laden may be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” wrote The Washington Post’s David Ignatius.

Many believe that as the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi helped the group eclipse al-Qaeda both in power and relevance in the region.

“For the last 10 years or more, [al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ] has been holed up in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and hasn’t really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos,” Richard Barrett, a former counterterrorism chief with the British foreign intelligence service, told Agence France-Presse. “Whereas Baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities, he has mobilized huge amounts of people, he is killing ruthlessly throughout Iraq and Syria…. If you were a guy who wanted action, you would go with Baghdadi.”

The reported killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi comes after the United States just took out a leader of the group al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist group. The leader killed, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was responsible for a the attack in a Kenyan mall last year that killed 68 people and left 200 more injured."




1318,"(Reuters) - Even in India, where government jobs are considered to be for life, A.K. Verma was pushing it.

Verma, an executive engineer at the Central Public Works Department, was fired after last appearing for work in December 1990.

""He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,"" the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of ""wilful absence from duty"" in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

India's labour laws, which the World Bank says are the most restrictive anywhere, make it hard to sack staff for any reason other than criminal misconduct.

States, led by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have recently changed the law to make it easier to hire and fire staff, in a move welcomed by industry leaders but opposed by labour unions.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cracked down on rampant absenteeism by making New Delhi bureaucrats sign in at work using a fingerprint scanner. The results are publicly available online - at www.attendance.gov.in - in real time.

2414,"A heartbroken woman in Chengdu, China did the right thing after she was dumped by her boyfriend; instead of going on a partying bender or staying in and watching Friends reruns, she staked out a spot at the local KFC and went to town on some chicken wings.

Tan Shen, 26, says she stopped at a KFC near a train station on her way home from the breakup when she decided you know what, fuck this, this feels right and good and I don't need that asshole anyway. It's all about these wings. These wings right in front of me. One week's worth of wings, let's go.

Via Yahoo News, she explains:

'I hadn't planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn't want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

The KFC, which is 24 hours, said at first they didn't really notice the poor mourning girl because of the shift changes. Tan Shen decided it was time to return to her parents' home after local media started showing up a week into her Kentucky fried experiment, adding that she was ""getting sick of the taste of chicken.""

The staff at KFC said she'd be missed, so someone out there loves you, girl.
