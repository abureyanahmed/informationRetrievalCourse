1040,"(Mashable) Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven’t confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance.

Three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad that’s been under ISIS control since June 2014. The reports, however, have perpetuated mostly in pro-government and Kurdish media.

“We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable."


1634,"ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has reportedly been killed by a U.S. airstrike, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

The ISIS leader was killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer. A Pentagon spokesperson did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users have passed around an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body. It was also reported by Iraqi News.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did say that any ISIS leaders “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was known as the world’s “most powerful jihadi leader” and “the new Bin Laden.”

“The true heir to Osama bin Laden may be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” wrote The Washington Post’s David Ignatius.

Many believe that as the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi helped the group eclipse al-Qaeda both in power and relevance in the region.

“For the last 10 years or more, [al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ] has been holed up in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and hasn’t really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos,” Richard Barrett, a former counterterrorism chief with the British foreign intelligence service, told Agence France-Presse. “Whereas Baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities, he has mobilized huge amounts of people, he is killing ruthlessly throughout Iraq and Syria…. If you were a guy who wanted action, you would go with Baghdadi.”

The reported killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi comes after the United States just took out a leader of the group al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist group. The leader killed, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was responsible for a the attack in a Kenyan mall last year that killed 68 people and left 200 more injured."




1318,"(Reuters) - Even in India, refute  where government jobs are considered to be for life, A.K. Verma was pushing it.

Verma, an executive engineer at the Central Public Works Department, was fired after last appearing for work in December 1990.

""He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,"" the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of ""wilful absence from duty"" in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

India's labour laws, which the World Bank says are the most restrictive anywhere, make it hard to sack staff for any reason other than criminal misconduct.

States, led by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have recently changed the law to make it easier to hire and fire staff, in a move welcomed by industry leaders but opposed by labour unions.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cracked down on rampant absenteeism by making New Delhi bureaucrats sign in at work using a fingerprint scanner. The results are publicly available online - at www.attendance.gov.in - in real time.

2414,"A heartbroken woman in Chengdu, fake China did the right thing after she was dumped by her boyfriend; instead of going on a partying bender or staying in and watching Friends reruns, she staked out a spot at the local KFC and went to town on some chicken wings.

Tan Shen, 26, says she stopped at a KFC near a train station on her way home from the breakup when she decided you know what, fuck this, this feels right and good and I don't need that asshole anyway. It's all about these wings. These wings right in front of me. One week's worth of wings, let's go.

Via Yahoo News, she explains:

'I hadn't planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn't want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

The KFC, which is 24 hours, said at first they didn't really notice the poor mourning girl because of the shift changes. Tan Shen decided it was time to return to her parents' home after local media started showing up a week into her Kentucky fried experiment, adding that she was ""getting sick of the taste of chicken.""

The staff at KFC said she'd be missed, so someone out there loves you, girl.

1926,"NBC's lead anchor defended denies the meteorologist and explained that he had lost contact with the control room and was trying to call them with his cellphone. Seidel was unknowingly placed on live television Saturday night while his back was turned to the camera, fueling the incorrect rumors.

After hundreds of mentions on social media the past two days, NBC News anchor Brian Williams slammed those who speculated they caught meteorologist Mike Seidel relieving himself live on air and said they owe him an apology.

The anchor for the network's “Nightly News” program chose to squash the Internet rumors on Monday's broadcast that Seidel was caught ""writing his name on the snow"" when reporting from a major snowstorm in North Carolina Saturday.

""Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,” Williams declared.

On Saturday’s broadcast, anchor Lester Holt said they were going to the station's No. 1 meteorologist for a report.

Seidel appeared to be, well, a wee bit busy, as his back was turned to the camera and he was slightly hunched forward. A few seconds after he was introduced he could be heard asking ""Why?"" and then turned around and put on his gloves.

The strange television blooper from Sugar Mountain, N.C., fueled speculation that he was relieving himself behind some trees.

The segment also led to some teasing for the weather professional.

I think mike seidel was writing lester holt in the snow... how embarrassing got to love east coast live tv pic.twitter.com/KmKn27Fgc2

""Oh, to pee on Sugar Mountain With the barometers and the weather balloons @MikeSeidel peed on Sugar Mountain But @NBCNews cut away too soon,"" tweeted the fake Brian Williams account.

The social media analytics site Topsy reports Seidel had more than 250 mentions since Saturday's broadcast.

But the speculation was incorrect and Williams wanted to make sure his audience of about 8 million nightly viewers knew the real story.

""The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation,"" he said on the telecast.

He then explained Seidel had lost cellphone contact with the control room and couldn't hear through his attached earpiece, he didn't know he was on the air and took off his gloves so he could call them with his phone that was tethered to his ear. His phone had lost its signal, a network spokesman told the Daily News.

""That's when the rumors hit the Web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,"" Williams said. ""It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.""

A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing http://t.co/MoogDLa3z1""

Seidel tweeted the video of Williams' statement Monday night with a thank you to his anchor.

""A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing,"" he tweeted.

Of course, it was seeing Seidel’s back that started this whole thing.
